We are grateful for ongoing collaboration and regular dialogue to statisticians from European Medicines Agency (EMA), 
Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA, UK), U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA, Japan), Health Canada, Swissmedic, National Medical Products Administration (NMPA, China) and Center for Drug Evaluation (CDE, Taiwan). 

Below you find the summaries of material presented at regular meetings with these stakeholders.

```{r, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
suppressWarnings(library("knitr"))
suppressWarnings(library("readxl"))
tab <- as.data.frame(read_excel("data/tc.xlsx"), col_types = rep("text", 5))
tab[is.na(tab)] <- ""
tab[, "Material"] <- paste("[Slidedecks and/or written updates](", tab[, "Material"], ")", sep = "")
kable(tab)
```

We also thank Keaven Anderson (Merck) and Frank Bretz (Novartis) for their support.
