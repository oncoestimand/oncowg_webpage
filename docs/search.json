Stefan Englert is a member of both working groups and leads that collaboration.\n\n\nPHUSE\nThe safety taskforce is a formal joint venture between the working group and PHUSE, and the safety taskforce is a formal part of the PHUSE organizational structure, see here. Jonathan Siegel is leading this collaboration.\n\n\nASA LIDS section\nThe censoring mechanism subteam with the ASA LIDS section. Although the oncology estimand WG is as a whole affiliated with the BIOP section, the censoring mechanism subteam had previously established a relationship with the ASA LIDS section. Jonathan Siegel is leading this collaboration.\nThe collaboration continues to bear fruit. For example, the “Time-to-event Estimands in Oncology” session at the upcoming LIDS 2023 conference is a direct result of the collaboration, as is Richard Cook’s periodic involvement in various EOI conference sessions and panels over the years. (Richard will be the discussant for our session at LIDS)."

For continuous outcomes with difference of means as efficacy estimand, Least Square estimates from the full model containing treatment, subgroup, and its interaction term enable an unbiased estimation of efficacy for the overall population by linearly combining estimands of the two subgroups. Following the same process for binary or time-to-event efficacy estimands such as hazard ratio or odds ratio, although guaranteeing logical inference in appearance, does not lead to the correct efficacy estimand of the overall population. In fact, the correct HR (or OR) may be outside of the interval of subgroup HRs (or ORs) leading to illogical interpretations. The task force will investigate which efficacy measures are logic respecting on the population level and make recommendations on how to analyze real clinical trial data so that analysis results based on these efficacy measures will always be logical for either prognostic or predictive biomarkers.\n\n\n\n\nFirstname\nLastname\nInstitution\nLocation\n\n\n\n\nSiyoen\nKil\nLSK Global Pharma Services\nAsia\n\n\nHong\nSun\nBMS\nEurope\n\n\nMin-Hua\nJen\nLilly\nEurope\n\n\nFrancois\nMercier\nRoche\nEurope\n\n\nShoubhik\nMondal\nAstraZeneca\nNorAm\n\n\nHong\nTian\nBeigene\nNorAm\n\n\nYue\nShentu\nDaiichi Sankyo\nNorAm\n\n\nHaiming\nZhou\nDaiichi Sankyo\nNorAm\n\n\nLiwei\nWang\nGenmab\nNorAm\n\n\nYi\nLiu\nNektar\nNorAm\n\n\nWenchuan\nGuo\nSeagen\nNorAm\n\n\nMiao\nYang\nSeagen\nNorAm"

    "text": "The estimand framework aims at aligning trial objectives and statistical analyses by demanding a precise definition of the inferential quantity of interest, the estimand. The addendum is anticipated to have a major impact on drug development, as the choice of an estimand will drive the trial design and sample size, conduct, data collection, and analysis of clinical trials moving forward. Furthermore, the framework is anticipated to facilitate discussions about relevant treatment effects, interpretation of study results, and added value of the drugs between sponsors, regulators, payers, physicians, and patients.\nThe need to amend E9 with a discussion on estimands grew out of the realization of an apparent lack of alignment between the objectives stated in a clinical trial protocol and the accompanying quantification and interpretation of the treatment effect reported in a regulatory submission. While the estimand framework has been developed with different clinical trial settings and endpoints in mind, the examples discussed in publications, at scientific meetings, and in the addendum have largely focused on symptomatic studies and continuous, longitudinal endpoints. However, in oncology primary endpoints in clinical trials are typically of the time-to-event (T2E) type (such as overall, progression-free, or event-free survival). For these endpoints, there are still many open questions concerning endpoint definition, data collection, analysis methodology, interpretation, and use in drug development. The working group aims at bringing together statisticians from industry, regulators, and academia to ensure common understanding and consistent definitions for key estimands in oncology across and share experiences, intercurrent events, and the used sensitivity analyses. Key questions that are discussed are:\n\nHow can time-to-event (T2E) endpoints be embedded in the addendum framework?\nWhat are key estimands and intercurrent events in Oncology?\nHow do the five strategies to handle intercurrent events proposed in the ICH E9 addendum apply to T2E endpoints?\nHow can established methods to answer questions in oncology, e.g. treatment switching or various censoring schemes, be embedded in the addendum framework, what estimands has been usually targeted?\nThe addendum in its current version does not require a causal interpretation of a proposed estimand. However, are there parts in the drug development lifecycle that require a causal interpretation of an estimand?\nBeing aware that the hazard ratio from Cox regression does not admit a causal interpretation, what are effect measures for T2E endpoints that are amenable to a causal interpretation?\nThe addendum in its current version does not require a causal interpretation of a proposed estimand. However, are there parts in the drug development lifecycle that require a causal interpretation of an estimand?\nBeing aware that the hazard ratio from Cox regression does not admit a causal interpretation, what are effect measures for T2E endpoints that are amenable to such a causal interpretation?\n\nFurthermore, increased transparency on the treatment effect of interest is considered an important goal of the addendum in order to facilitate discussions between different stakeholders. However, no guidance on protocol implementation has been provided so far, and there is a risk that the same estimand will be described in different ways by sponsors, potentially leading to confusion for regulators, physicians, patients, and possibly even inconsistent labels. Therefore, it is desired to ensure common understanding and consistent definitions for estimands across industry."

    "text": "Achievements 2022\nThe group continues to be an influential player in the global discussion on estimands between industry, regulators, and academia. Key achievements in 2022 are:\n\nGeneral activities listed as achievements in last years below are continued by the group.\nSeveral publications of the SIG appeared or have been submitted this year.\nTwo SIG papers published in 2021 were among the five most downloaded in Pharmaceutical statistics in 2021, see publications.\nThe SIG gave many talks and organized sessions at conferences and webinars, see events. Some highlights:\n\nAn entire session organized by the SIG at the PSI conference.\nThe SIG organized two sessions at the ASA FDA workshop (“Adjusted and Unadjusted Estimate in Clinical Trials: Reward, Risk and Myth” and “Estimands in Oncology: A Topical Panel Discussion”), see events page.\nDIA held a webinar in China, with a talk by Jiajun Xu from the conditional and marginal effect force. With a peak attendance of 4460 colleagues this likely sets a new record for a talk by this WG!\nTogether with ASA NJ chapter the WG co-organized a webinar ASA New Jersey Chapter Webinar Series: Getting the question right: Applying the Estimand and Target Trial Frameworks with External Controls.\n\nOn June 28th & 29th we had two full group TCs with regulators attending where we presented our work. Slidedecks are available here.\neunethta is currently seeking comments for their set of guidelines for a joint clinical assessment of European HTA bodies. Several of the WG’s papers were cited in EFPIA’s response to deliverable 4.5.\nAs of November 2022, the SIG has 99 members (37 from Europe, 52 from US, and 10 from Asia) representing 48 companies / institutions, see status.\n\n\n\nAchievements 2021\nThe group has evolved into a global network of statisticians in industry and regulatory agencies that continues to contribute to the implementation of the ICH E9 addendum. Key achievements are:\n\nSeveral publications of the SIG appeared this year.\nThe SIG has built a network of individuals with expertise and credibility in the broader biostatistical and drug development community. Testament to that is the fact that SIG members are regularly invited to review and comment on scientific publications in the field.\nInvited by the EFSPI/EFPIA estimands implementation working group the SIG organized two webinars targeted at a broad audience of Clinicians, Investigators, Regulatory Experts, Medical Writers, Ethics Committees, Statisticians:\n\nPSI EIWG Webinars (2 events, one for EU and one for US): Estimands in Oncology - How and Why.\nThe WG also organized a DIA Webinar with the same target audience, including FDA discussants.\n\nOur SIG is also formally represented in the EFSPI/EFPIA estimands implementation working group.\nThe SIG organized sessions and was invited to speak at conferences (Duke Industry Statistics Symposium, Society for clinicial trials, JSM, ASA-FDA workshop, ISOQoL). Further talks were given at several occasions.\nMembers of the SIG were also invited to FDA OCE Project Significant TCs to talk about application of estimands to decentralized trials and comment on non-proportional hazards.\nAs a higlight of 2021 nine task forces were kicked off who have started their work on new topics relevant to the implementation of the addendum, and applying the addendum to extended areas such as, e.g., real-worl data. Find them all, including rosters and objectives, here.\nAs of November 2021, the SIG has has 77 members (30 from Europe, 38 from US, and 9 from Asia) representing 36 companies / institutions, see status.\nAs an outlook in 2022 we plan to organize webinars reporting on the content that the task forces have generated so far. One goal is also to broaden our outreach and present not only at statistical but also at clinical conferences. We also plan to get involved with our Health Authority partners again.\n\n\n\nAchievements 2020\nDespite the many challenges in 2020 the SIG was able to relevantly contribute to the implementation of the estimand addendum in drug development in oncology and beyond. Key achievements are:\n\nThe intercontinental team spirit that allowed to come up with a rapid response to COVID-19 pandemic: a slidedeck discussing the impact of the pandemic on a trial’s estimand was published on the webpage less than five weeks after WHO declared the pandemic. A paper followed only a few weeks later.\nSeveral publications of the SIG were published this year, and several more are in their last rounds of revision.\nThe SIG organized two webinars that brought together drug developers, academics, and regulators to discuss topics around estimands in oncology and beyond:\n\nEstimands addendum is final: Anything new for oncology?: The highlight here was that several clinical colleagues contributed as presenters and panelists.\nRCTs meeting causal inference: principal stratum strategy and beyond.\n\nThe SIG organized sessions and was invited to speak at virtual US conferences (JSM, ASA-FDA workshop, Deming conference on applied statistics). Further talks were given at several occasions.\nThe SIG organized TCs with seven Health Authorities (FDA, HC, Swissmedic, China, Japan, Taiwan, MHRA) to share its work and get input on future directions.\nSet up a webpage (www.oncoestimand.org) to foster sharing of information and generated content such as presentations and publications. As of today, the SIG has 54 members (20 from Europe, 29 from US, and 5 from Asia) representing 28 companies. Currently the SIG is regrouping in task forces dedicated to eight topics that are considered relevant to develop implementation of the addendum further in oncology clinical trials. So expect more output in 2021!\n\n\n\nAchievements 2019\nThe WG created a platform for sharing experience and ensuring common understanding of estimands in oncology trials across industry and continues to grow both in terms of members and companies. The discussions within the WG advanced in all subteams and several manuscripts are under preparation. As planned, the initial content was disseminated in 2019 via several statistical conferences in Europe and US. One publication was submitted in 2019 and several submissions are planned in 2020. The WG engaged with the Clinical community and submitted abstracts to several Clinical conferences in collaboration with key opinion leaders and industry clinicians, a poster was presented at ESMO. Similarly, the collaboration with Health Authorities is ongoing and expected to continue over several years. Furthermore, the SWG also had some initial discussions with academia statisticians on potential topics for collaboration in future.\nThe WG highlighted various estimand problems in Oncology and shared the view of the SWG in many presentations at conferences in Europe and US and in collaboration with EMA and FDA:\n\ninvited talk at HTA EFSPI SIG 1-day event (Berlin, February 2019)\nsession (4 talks) at DAGStat (Munich, March 2019)\nsession (3 talks by WG members and EMA discussant) at LiDS conference (Pittsburgh, June 2019)\n2 talks at PSI conference (London, June 2019)\n1 talk at DIA Annual meeting (San Diego, June 2019)\n1 talk at ISCB conference (Leuven, July 2019)\nsession (4 talks and FDA discussant) at JSM (Denver, July 2019)\ntalk at EFSPI regulatory (Basel, September 2019)\nsession (3 talks) and invited to participate in a panel discussion at ASA Biopharmaceutical Section Regulatory-Industry Statistics Workshop (September 2019)\ntalk at ISOQoL conference (San Diego, October 2019)\nPoster on estimands in adjuvant renal cell carcinoma in collaboration with key opinion leaders and industry clinicians at ESMO (September 2019)"

    "text": "The draft addendum of the ICH E9 guideline on Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials was released in August 2017 and introduced an estimand framework. In February 2018, Evgeny Degtyarev from Novartis and Kaspar Rufibach from Roche started an informal working group to discuss how to implement the draft addendum in oncological clinical trials.\nIn November 2018, the working group was subsequently established more formally by EFSPI as European special interest group “Estimands in oncology”, sponsored by PSI and EFSPI and in June 2019 the ASA biopharmaceutical section has granted the official status as ASA scientific working group.\nIn December 2019, the final version of the ICH E9 estimand addendum was published."

Objectives and member rosters of these task forces are available here.\n\n\nActivities\nBeyond work in the task forces, the aim of the working group is to provide answers to the above questions through a variety of activities. These will include:\n\nCollaborating with experts to refine and possibly extend available methods.\nPublishing reviews of the available methods, case studies, and white papers with recommendations, for statisticians and non-statisticians.\nInteracting with regulators and the broader clinical community to obtain a better understanding of their requirements. Work with them to agree on common definitions of estimands in oncology.\nProviding trainings, workshops and talks.\nPromoting good practice through templates for study protocols and statistical analysis plans."

    "text": "Hi all,\nWe hope this reaches you well! It has been a while since we last reached out to the entire group. We would like to share some recent developments, events, and achievements.\n\nOur clinical engagement task force organized a second webinar targeting all our partner functions in pharma development. Find details on our events page - registration is still open!\nWe also contribute to several sessions at the upcoming ASA Biopharmaceutical Section Regulatory-Industry Statistics Workshop 2021, see again on the events page.\nMeanwhile, six papers out of our WG have been accepted or published. All of these are available for download in our gFolder here.\n8 out of 9 task forces have started their work. We would also like to initiate work on task force 2 Principal stratification for treatment switching - if you’d be interested to contribute please let us know. We intend to kick this task force now, after the acceptance of the paper about treatment switching (see gFolder here).\nWe will also reach out to all task force leads to check in where their groups currently are and where the entire group can potentially support them. Our vision for 2022 is that we organize a oncology estimand working group webinar series where task forces report on their work.\nLast week a 1 1/2 page paper introducing estimands using the PIONEER trials as an example appeared in JAMA. Having more and more such papers likely opens the door for publishing on estimand topics in clinical journals and interacting more with clinicians. Of note that personally (KR) I do not agree with quite a few things they write, e.g. how they define ITT - they mix up estimand attributes and analysis sets. But seing clinical journals publish estimands papers overall seems good to me.\nFurther past events of note were the EFSPI regulatory statistics workshop with a talk by Michael O’Kelly on how to deal with multiple estimands per tial. Recordings will also be up soon! Several of our members were also involved in the discussion in the last FDA - lungevity meeting on NPH.\nFinally - are there any new estimand topics where this group could potentially contribute its knowledge and network? If you have such topics please do not hesitate to get back to us!\n\nTo conclude, we invite you to regularly check out our webpage: www.oncoestimand.org.\nKind Regards, Evgeny & Kaspar"

We would like to share some recent developments, events, and achievements.\n\nSince the last newsletter one additional paper has been accepted (Hampson et al., 2022) and two papers have been submitted (Siegel et al., 2022a and Siegel et al., 2022b), summarizing the work of the censoring subteam. See the publications page for details.\nWe have updated the events page with our past and upcoming appearances. Here are some of the upcoming highlights where the WG will contribute:\n\nTwo WG talks at the Society for Clinical Trials conference.\nASA biopharm section webinar.\nThe WG has organized an entire session at the PSI conference and Stefan Englert will present a poster.\nWG talks at the International Chinese Statistical Association Applied Statistics Symposium, JSM, ISCB, ISOQoL.\nContributed topic session at the ASA FDA workshop.\n\nFind details on WG speakers, dates, and session / talk titles on our events page. Please let us know of further presentations, workshops, webinars, etc that are not on the list yet! And send us slidedecks to be posted on the webpage.\nPlease also share slidedecks or links to other material that we can add to the events page.\nThe engagement task force has put together a nice poster that will be presented at conferences in Europe, Asia, and the US. This may serve as a good resource if you’d like to present the WG.\nThe 7th EFSPI regulatory statistics workshop will again take place face-to-face in Basel this year. Check out the draft program, it is already very exciting! Stefan will again present the WG poster there in a session featuring several EFSPI / PSI special interest groups.\nEMA has issued Advice to sponsors on managing the impact of the war in Ukraine on clinical trials which heavily uses the estimand framework. They call out the hypothetical estimand strategy specifically.\nThe EFSPI/EFPIA Estimands Implementation WG (EIWG) has published a paper Marking 2-Years of New Thinking in Clinical Trials: The Estimand Journey. The paper is well worth a read.\nOn June 28th & 29th we will again have full group TCs with regulators attending (you should have invites in your calendars). We plan to run these sessions as the last ones, i.e. each task force is asked to present the status of their work.\n\nTo conclude, we invite you to regularly check out our webpage: www.oncoestimand.org.\nKind Regards, Evgeny & Kaspar"
