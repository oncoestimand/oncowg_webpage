    "text": "Achievements 2021\nThe group has evolved into a global network of statisticians in industry and regulatory agencies that continues to contribute to the implementation of the ICH E9 addendum. Key achievements are:\n\nSeveral publications of the SIG appeared this year.\nThe SIG has built a network of individuals with expertise and credibility in the broader biostatistical and drug development community. Testament to that is the fact that SIG members are regularly invited to review and comment on scientific publications in the field.\nInvited by the EFSPI/EFPIA estimands implementation working group the SIG organized two webinars targeted at a broad audience of Clinicians, Investigators, Regulatory Experts, Medical Writers, Ethics Committees, Statisticians:\n\nPSI EIWG Webinars (2 events, one for EU and one for US): Estimands in Oncology - How and Why.\n\nThe WG also organized a DIA Webinar with the same target audience, including FDA discussants.\nOur SIG is also formally represented in the EFSPI/EFPIA estimands implementation working group.\nThe SIG organized sessions and was invited to speak at conferences (Duke Industry Statistics Symposium, Society for clinicial trials, JSM, ASA-FDA workshop, ISOQoL). Further talks were given at several occasions.\nMembers of the SIG were also invited to FDA OCE Project Significant TCs to talk about application of estimands to decentralized trials and comment on non-proportional hazards.\nAs a higlight of 2021 nine task forces were kicked off who have started their work on new topics relevant to the implementation of the addendum, and applying the addendum to extended areas such as, e.g., real-worl data. Find them all, including rosters and objectives, here.\nAs of November 2021, the SIG has has 77 members (30 from Europe, 38 from US, and 9 from Asia) representing 36 companies / institutions, see status.\nAs an outlook in 2022 we plan to organize webinars reporting on the content that the task forces have generated so far. One goal is also to broaden our outreach and present not only at statistical but also at clinical conferences. We also plan to get involved with our Health Authority partners again.\n\n\n\nAchievements 2020\nDespite the many challenges in 2020 the SIG was able to relevantly contribute to the implementation of the estimand addendum in drug development in oncology and beyond. Key achievements are:\n\nThe intercontinental team spirit that allowed to come up with a rapid response to COVID-19 pandemic: a slidedeck discussing the impact of the pandemic on a trial’s estimand was published on the webpage less than five weeks after WHO declared the pandemic. A paper followed only a few weeks later.\nSeveral publications of the SIG were published this year, and several more are in their last rounds of revision.\nThe SIG organized two webinars that brought together drug developers, academics, and regulators to discuss topics around estimands in oncology and beyond:\n\nEstimands addendum is final: Anything new for oncology?: The highlight here was that several clinical colleagues contributed as presenters and panelists.\nRCTs meeting causal inference: principal stratum strategy and beyond.\n\nThe SIG organized sessions and was invited to speak at virtual US conferences (JSM, ASA-FDA workshop, Deming conference on applied statistics). Further talks were given at several occasions.\nThe SIG organized TCs with seven Health Authorities (FDA, HC, Swissmedic, China, Japan, Taiwan, MHRA) to share its work and get input on future directions.\nSet up a webpage (www.oncoestimand.org) to foster sharing of information and generated content such as presentations and publications. As of today, the SIG has 54 members (20 from Europe, 29 from US, and 5 from Asia) representing 28 companies. Currently the SIG is regrouping in task forces dedicated to eight topics that are considered relevant to develop implementation of the addendum further in oncology clinical trials. So expect more output in 2021!\n\n\n\nAchievements 2019\nThe WG created a platform for sharing experience and ensuring common understanding of estimands in oncology trials across industry and continues to grow both in terms of members and companies. The discussions within the WG advanced in all subteams and several manuscripts are under preparation. As planned, the initial content was disseminated in 2019 via several statistical conferences in Europe and US. One publication was submitted in 2019 and several submissions are planned in 2020. The WG engaged with the Clinical community and submitted abstracts to several Clinical conferences in collaboration with key opinion leaders and industry clinicians, a poster was presented at ESMO. Similarly, the collaboration with Health Authorities is ongoing and expected to continue over several years. Furthermore, the SWG also had some initial discussions with academia statisticians on potential topics for collaboration in future.\nThe WG highlighted various estimand problems in Oncology and shared the view of the SWG in many presentations at conferences in Europe and US and in collaboration with EMA and FDA:\n\ninvited talk at HTA EFSPI SIG 1-day event (Berlin, February 2019)\nsession (4 talks) at DAGStat (Munich, March 2019)\nsession (3 talks by WG members and EMA discussant) at LiDS conference (Pittsburgh, June 2019)\n2 talks at PSI conference (London, June 2019)\n1 talk at DIA Annual meeting (San Diego, June 2019)\n1 talk at ISCB conference (Leuven, July 2019)\nsession (4 talks and FDA discussant) at JSM (Denver, July 2019)\ntalk at EFSPI regulatory (Basel, September 2019)\nsession (3 talks) and invited to participate in a panel discussion at ASA Biopharmaceutical Section Regulatory-Industry Statistics Workshop (September 2019)\ntalk at ISOQoL conference (San Diego, October 2019)\nPoster on estimands in adjuvant renal cell carcinoma in collaboration with key opinion leaders and industry clinicians at ESMO (September 2019)"

    "section": "",
    "text": "The need to amend E9 with a discussion on estimands grew out of the realization of an apparent lack of alignment between the objectives stated in a clinical trial protocol and the accompanying quantification and interpretation of the treatment effect reported in a regulatory submission. While the estimand framework has been developed with different clinical trial settings and endpoints in mind, the examples discussed in publications, at scientific meetings, and in the addendum have largely focused on symptomatic studies and continuous, longitudinal endpoints. However, in oncology primary endpoints in clinical trials are typically of the time-to-event (T2E) type (such as overall, progression-free, or event-free survival). For these endpoints, there are still many open questions concerning endpoint definition, data collection, analysis methodology, interpretation, and use in drug development. The working group aims at bringing together statisticians from industry, regulators, and academia to ensure common understanding and consistent definitions for key estimands in oncology across and share experiences, intercurrent events, and the used sensitivity analyses. Key questions that are discussed are:\n\nHow can time-to-event (T2E) endpoints be embedded in the addendum framework?\nWhat are key estimands and intercurrent events in Oncology?\nHow do the five strategies to handle intercurrent events proposed in the ICH E9 addendum apply to T2E endpoints?\nHow can established methods to answer questions in oncology, e.g. treatment switching or various censoring schemes, be embedded in the addendum framework, what estimands has been usually targeted?\nThe addendum in its current version does not require a causal interpretation of a proposed estimand. However, are there parts in the drug development lifecycle that require a causal interpretation of an estimand?\nBeing aware that the hazard ratio from Cox regression does not admit a causal interpretation, what are effect measures for T2E endpoints that are amenable to a causal interpretation?\nThe addendum in its current version does not require a causal interpretation of a proposed estimand. However, are there parts in the drug development lifecycle that require a causal interpretation of an estimand?\nBeing aware that the hazard ratio from Cox regression does not admit a causal interpretation, what are effect measures for T2E endpoints that are amenable to such a causal interpretation?\n\nFurthermore, increased transparency on the treatment effect of interest is considered an important goal of the addendum in order to facilitate discussions between different stakeholders. However, no guidance on protocol implementation has been provided so far, and there is a risk that the same estimand will be described in different ways by sponsors, potentially leading to confusion for regulators, physicians, patients, and possibly even inconsistent labels. Therefore, it is desired to ensure common understanding and consistent definitions for estimands across industry."

Following the same process for binary or time-to-event efficacy estimands such as hazard ratio or odds ratio, although guaranteeing logical inference in appearance, does not lead to the correct efficacy estimand of the overall population. In fact, the correct HR (or OR) may be outside of the interval of subgroup HRs (or ORs) leading to illogical interpretations.

In this WG, we intend to implement the ICH-E9 addendum and to reflect on the challenges it presents in early clinical development studies. Such challenges may include: (1) absence of control group (2) varying dose, but also dosing schedule across treatment arms (a.k.a. cohorts) (3) presence of anti-drug antibody (ADA) (4) prophylactic treatment or co-medication for toxicity mitigation (e.g. using steroids) (5) compassionate within-patient dose escalation. The taskforce will give clinically relevant opinions and recommendations based on our analysis and interpretation of the selected case studies. Contact to other task forces will be sought based on need.\n\n\n\n\nFirstname\nLastname\nInstitution\nLocation\n\n\n\n\nElizabeth\nPilling\nAstraZeneca\nEurope\n\n\nStefan\nEnglert\nJ&J\nEurope\n\n\nChristina\nHabermehl\nMerck\nEurope\n\n\nAnja\nVictor\nMerck\nEurope\n\n\nFrancois\nMercier\nRoche\nEurope\n\n\nAtalanta\nGhosh\nBMS\nNorAm\n\n\nJunxian\nGeng\nBoehringer\nNorAm\n\n\nHongtao\nZhang\nMerck\nNorAm\n\n\nNatalia\nKan-Dobrosky\nPPDI\nNorAm\n\n\nGuillaume\nLecorps\nSanofi\nNorAm\n\n\nXiaojiang\nZhan\nServier\nNorAm"

    "text": "Estimands for Safety\nLead: Jonathan Siegel (Bayer)\nObjective: Key issues of interest for this task force are: (1) Estimands for safety-focused studies (2) Safety estimands within the context of a conventional efficacy study (3) Implementing estimands principles in general safety reporting and analysis (including what to change and what to leave in place) (4) Implementing estimands principles in associated CRF and data standards. The mission of the group is up for discussion and I would appreciate your interest.\nThe envisioned output for the group would be white papers, one focused on study design and statistical methodological considerations in safety estimands, and one focused on more nuts-and-bolts implementation issues including recommendations for general safety reporting, visit schedule and withdrawal criteria issues, monitoring, CRF considerations, data considerations and changes in data standards etc. In addition, the TF plans to involve itself in WG discussions with and recommendations to regulatory authorities, conference presentations, outreach webinars and workshops, etc.\n\n\n\n\nFirstname\nLastname\nInstitution\nLocation\n\n\n\n\nJiawei\nWei\nNovartis\nAsia\n\n\nAlexander\nStemke\nBoehringer Ingelheim\nEurope\n\n\nAlan\nPhillips\nICON\nEurope\n\n\nMarie-Laure\nCasadebaig\nIncyte\nEurope\n\n\nAnja-Helena\nLoos\nMerck\nEurope\n\n\nPedro\nLopez Romero\nNovartis\nEurope\n\n\nRemi\nAprahamian\nServier\nEurope\n\n\nJonathan\nSiegel\nBayer\nNorAm\n\n\nJames\nBuchanan\nCovilance\nNorAm\n\n\nPhilip\nHe\nDSI\nNorAm\n\n\nShayami\nThanabalasundrum\nExelis\nNorAm\n\n\nSteven\nSun\nJ&J\nNorAm\n\n\nMary\nNilsson\nLilly\nNorAm\n\n\nHongtao\nZhang\nMerck\nNorAm\n\n\nYi\nLan\nNovartis\nNorAm\n\n\nGreg\nBall\nNovavax\nNorAm\n\n\nNatalia\nKan-Dobrosky\nPPDI\nNorAm\n\n\nRui\nTang\nServier\nNorAm\n\n\nCraig\nMallinckrodt\nNA\nNorAm\n\n\nIsabel\nHuang\nICON\nNA"
