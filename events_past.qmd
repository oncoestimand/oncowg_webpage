Below a list of past events with contributions of the WG, with links to slidedecks and recordings (where available).

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, include = FALSE}

# how to do this with child documents: https://gist.github.com/rmoff/a043676a2f084b81a434

out1 <- NULL
for (i in 1:nrow(talks)){
  out1 <- c(out1, knit_expand('tools/conf1.Rmd'))
}

# the "knit" command somehow produces unwanted output, this is why I assign its output to a and use a separate chunk to display a
a <- knit(text = unlist(paste(out1, collapse = '\n')), quiet = TRUE)
```

```{r conferences, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, results = "asis"}
cat(a)
```
