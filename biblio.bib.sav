  pages    = {1-10},
  abstract = {The diversity of patient journeys can raise fundamental questions regarding the evaluation of drug effects in clinical trials to inform clinical practice. When defining the treatment effect of interest in a trial, the researcher needs to account for events occurring after treatment initiation, such as the start of a new therapy, before observing the end point. We review the newly introduced estimand framework to structure discussions on the relationship between patient journeys and the treatment effect of interest in oncology trials. In 2017, the International Council for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use released a draft addendum to its E9 guideline. The addendum introduces the concept of an estimand to precisely describe the treatment effect of interest. This estimand framework provides a structured approach to discuss how to account for intercurrent events that occur after random assignment and may affect the assessment or interpretation of the treatment effect. The framework is expected to improve coherence between trial objectives, design, analysis, and interpretation, as illustrated by examples in oncology disease settings. The estimand framework was applied to design a trial for a chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy. The treatment effect of interest was carefully defined considering the range of patient journeys expected for this particular indication and treatment. The trial design was developed accordingly to assess that treatment effect. All parties involved in the design of clinical trials need to consider possible patient journeys to define appropriate treatment effects and corresponding trial designs and analysis strategies. The estimand framework provides a common language to address the complexity introduced by varied patient journeys.},

  number   = {23},

  abstract = {The treatment effect in subgroups of patients is often of interest in randomized controlled clinical trials, as this may provide useful information on how to treat which patients best. When a specific subgroup is characterized by the absence of certain events that happen postrandomization, a naive analysis on the subset of patients without these events may be misleading. The principal stratification framework allows one to define an appropriate causal estimand in such settings. Statistical inference for the principal stratum estimand hinges on scientifically justified assumptions, which can be included with Bayesian methods through prior distributions. Our motivating example is a large randomized placebo-controlled trial of siponimod in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. The primary objective of this trial was to demonstrate the efficacy of siponimod relative to placebo in delaying disability progression for the whole study population. However, the treatment effect in the subgroup of patients who would not relapse during the trial is relevant from both a scientific and patient perspective. Assessing this subgroup treatment effect is challenging as there is strong evidence that siponimod reduces relapses. We describe in detail the scientific question of interest, the principal stratum estimand, the corresponding analysis method for binary endpoints, and sensitivity analyses. Although our work is motivated by a randomized clinical trial, the approach has broader appeal and could be adapted for observational studies.},
