# Purpose

Find on this webpage information on the working group on estimands in oncology.

# Status

The working group has been very successful in supporting implementation of the ICH E9(R1) estimands addendum in routine drug development, see [talks](events_past.html) and [publications](publications.html). Currently, [task forces](taskforces.html) are wrapping up their work. Some of them will continue their work under other EFSPI / PSI / ASA working groups and may take new members. Please directly reach out to them as indicated [here](taskforces.html).

# Membership in professional organizations

In November 2018, the working group was established by [EFSPI](https://www.efspi.org) as [*European special interest group "Estimands in oncology", sponsored by PSI and EFSPI*](https://efspi.org/EFSPI/SIGS/EFSPI/Special_Interest_Groups/Special_Interest_Groups.aspx?hkey=4ba906dc-003a-4b71-b14b-7ea694a9b445) and in June 2019 the [*ASA biopharmaceutical section*](https://community.amstat.org/biop/home) has granted the official status as [ASA scientific working group](https://community.amstat.org/biop/workinggroups/eio).
