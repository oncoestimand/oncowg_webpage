# Purpose

Find on this webpage information on the working group on estimands in oncology.

# Become a member

The general spirit of the working group is inclusive. If you'd like to contribute in one or the other way, we propose you first reach out to your company's representative(s) (if applicable) and align within your company who is best placed to contribute to which task force. After that is clarified reach out to the WG leads - contact details available [here](organization.html).

# Membership in professional organizations

In November 2018, the working group was established by [EFSPI](https://www.efspi.org) as [_European special interest group "Estimands in oncology", sponsored by PSI and EFSPI_](https://www.efspi.org/EFSPI/Special_Interest_Groups/Estimands_in_Oncology_Applications.aspx?&WebsiteKey=0b28fec8-fcd6-4283-b360-0c689a893140&hkey=956f9eca-da64-48a4-88e4-e77d796bb527) and in June 2019 the [_ASA biopharmaceutical section_](https://community.amstat.org/biop/home) has granted the official status as [ASA scientific working group](https://community.amstat.org/biop/workinggroups/eio).
